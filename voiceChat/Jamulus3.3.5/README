Jamulus - Internet Jam Session Software
---------------------------------------

Low-Latency (Internet) Connection tool
Under the GNU General Public License (GPL)
http://llcon.sourceforge.net


INTRODUCTION:
The Jamulus software enables musicians to perform real-time jam sessions over
the internet. There is one server running the Jamulus server software which
collects the audio data from each Jamulus client, mixes the audio data
and sends the mix back to each client.

Jamulus is Open Source software (GPL, GNU General Public License) and runs under
Windows (ASIO), MacOS (Core Audio) and Linux (Jack). It is based on the Qt
framework and uses the OPUS audio codec. 

The required minimum internet connection speed is 200 kbps for the up- and
downstream. The ping time from your computer to the server should not exceed
40 ms average.

The source code is hosted at Sourceforge.net.
